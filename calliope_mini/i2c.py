class MicroBitI2C:
    """
    The ``i2c`` module lets you communicate with devices connected to your
    board using the I²C bus protocol. There can be multiple slave devices
    connected at the same time, and each one has its own unique address, that
    is either fixed for the device or configured on it. Your board acts as the
    I²C master.

    The left Grove connector (next to button A) is I²C-capable.

    How exactly you should communicate with the devices, that is, what bytes to
    send and how to interpret the responses, depends on the device in question
    and should be described separately in that device's documentation.

    There are internal pull-up resistors on the I²C lines of the board, but
    with particularly long wires or large number of devices you may need to add
    additional pull-up resistors, to ensure noise-free communication.
