"""
The os module provides a way to get basic information about the files in the
simple file system on the Calliope Mini and the Calliope Mini itself.

The os module only has the functions
- remove(filename: str)
- listdir() -> List[str]:
- size(filename: str) -> int:
- uname()

Since there is a "real" os module in your python installation, your IDE will
propose functions that are not available in MicroPython.


To read from/write to those files, use e.g. ``open(filename, "r")``.
